## CODE TO READ IN DF
df <- read_rds(here::here("df.rds"))
```

Short for regular expressions, regex (pronounced reg-ex) is a language for describing patterns in strings.

Like any language, regex will appear foreign and difficult to understand without constantly looking up definitions for symbols. A good dictionary is the regex cheat sheet; search for "Regular Expressions" in <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>. The important definitions are in the left and bottom boxes.

Why learn this language? When do you need a language for describing patterns in strings?

## Motivation

The first definition under heading "Character Classes" is

```         
[[:digit:]] or \\d  Digits; [0-9]
```

This tells us that to represent digits in patterns, we can write `"[[:digit:]]"` or `"\\d"`.

When do we need patterns? Let's say we want to make sure each row in the `date` column of our `df` has exactly 8 digits: 4 for the year, 2 for the month and 2 for the day. We cannot write the 8 digits directly, we need to represent them abstractly; that is the responsibility of patterns.

The pattern for digits is `"[[:digit:]]"` or `"\\d"`. Now we need a pattern for "8 times". We also cannot simply write 8, as we want to avoid representing the character 8. We now look for the abstract pattern representing "times": or, in other words, "occurences". On the bottom right, this pattern will be under the grey heading "Quantifiers".

The 4th defintion is

```         
{n}  Matches exactly n times
```

This tells us that to match 8 times, we can write `"{8}"`.

Combining what we learned about digits, we now write a pattern for digits 8 times: `"\\d{8}"`.

Before using this pattern, let us try to understand each symbol. The `\\` are needed to make sure that the pattern is not for the character "d" itself. Similarly, the `{` and `}` are needed to make sure that the pattern is not for the number "8" itself.

If we try to use our pattern to filter for dates with 8 digits, we get the following

```{r}
df |> filter(date |> str_detect("\\d{8}"))
```

0 rows in our date column have digits exactly 8 times. How can that be?

Looking back at our date column, what do we see?

```{r}
df
```

`date` has 4 digits, followed by a *hyphen*, followed by 2 digits, followed by a *hyphen*, followed by 2 digits. Our pattern simply represents 8 digits, one after the other with nothing in between.

If we alter our pattern to `"\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}"`, we get the expected result:

```{r}
df |> filter(date |> str_detect("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}"))
```

Now we not only checked that each row in `date` has 8 digits, but that theses digits are separated by hyphens in a XXXX-XX-XX format.

We still have not confirmed that the `date` column is in YYYY-MM-DD format (year-month-day format). This is unfortunately impossible for some cases. We cannot determine whether 02-04 is February 4nd or April 2nd unless we know whether the date was entered as MM-DD or DD-MM. Fortunately we can check cases where the day is greater than the 12th. We do so by checking whether the month in YYYY-MM-DD is between 01 and 12.

To do so we will adjust our pattern slightly so that month becomes a reference. To make a reference in a pattern, we surround the part we want to reference with round brackets: `(` and `)`.

```{r}
pattern <- "\\d{4}-(\\d{2})-\\d{2}"
```

To extract the reference, we must refer to it by number. We need to use a number, as it is possible to have more than one reference group. Again we use `\\` to make sure the pattern is not for the number "1" itself.

```{r}
replacement <- "\\1"
```

We now use our pattern and replacement in the function `str_replace`:

```{r}
month <- "2022-13-01" |> str_replace(pattern, replacement)
month
```

We can treat this as numeric.

```{r}
month |> as.numeric()
```

And then check whether it is above 12.

```{r}
month |> as.numeric() > 12
```

To do this for every row of our data frame, we will create a month column, treat it as numeric, and filter by values greater than 12:

```{r}

df <- df |> 
  mutate(month = date |> str_replace("\\d{4}-(\\d{2})-\\d{2}", "\\1") |> as.numeric())

df |> filter(month > 12)

```

There are no rows where month is greater than 12. Notice how the `mutate` is on a separate line after the pump `|>`. This is so that the `mutate` can fit on one line as opposed to the less easily readable version below.

```{r}
df <- df |> mutate(month = date |> str_replace("\\d{4}-(\\d{2})-\\d{2}", "\\1") |> as.numeric())

```

## Understanding Representations

If data contains characters like quotes and backslashes, R cannot directly represent them in a string. We can try to write each of these directly in a string and see what happens.

*Quotes:*

```{r error = TRUE}
"""
```

R reads the first two set of quotes `""` as an empty string, and considers the third set to be starting a second, incomplete string.

*Backslash:*

```{r error = TRUE}
"\"
```

The backslash has a special behaviour, preventing the second `"` from ending the string.

*Solution:*

Since R cannot represent quotes and backslash directly, it must instead represent them indirectly with special sequences of characters. For quotes, the representative sequence in R is `\"`. For a backslash, the sequence is `\\`.

When we place these sequences in strings, the output is not an error.

```{r}
"\"" 
```

```{r}
"\\"
```

Further, we can see what each sequence represents by using the function `writeLines`:

```{r}
"\"" |> writeLines()
```

```{r}
"\\" |> writeLines()
```

Sequences `\"` and `\\` start with a backslash because a backslash has a specific behaviour: it prevents the normal interpretation of the next character. The backslash in the string`"\""` prevents the second quotes from being interpreted as the end of the string. As for the string `"\\"`, because of the first backslash the second backslash is not normally interpreted as "preventing the normal interpretation of the next character". Yes you will likely have to re-read that.

`\"` and `\\` are called special characters. Special characters are called special because they hold a special property: they each represent *one* thing (a unique character that cannot be represented directly). `\"` represents quotes, and `\\` represents backslash. Scan the following list of special characters and what they represent.

| Special Characters | Represents                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| \\n                | newline                          |
| \\r                | carriage return                  |
| \\t                | tab                              |
| \\b                | backspace                        |
| \\a                | alert (bell)                     |
| \\f                | form feed                        |
| \\v                | vertical tab                     |
| \\\\               | backslash \\                     |
| \\'                | ASCII apostrophe '               |
| \\"                | ASCII quotation mark "           |
| \\\`               | ASCII grave accent (backtick) \` |

Notice how each has *one* backslash except for the case of `\\`. Again these special characters represent *one* thing. Representations of *multiple* things, however, have *multiple* backslashes (two to be exact). As an example, `\\d` represents multiple things because it represents any of the multiple digits from 0 to 9.

`\\` is a strange case. It is the only special character representing *one* thing with *multiple* backslashes. It is an even stranger case when used inside a pattern. We get an error:

```{r error = TRUE}
pattern <- "\\"
"\\" |> str_detect("\\")
```

An error does not happen with any of the other special characters used in this way. The reason is that `\\` is already used in patterns like `\\d`. If the pattern to match the string `"\\"` was simply `"\\"`, representations like `\\d` would lose their meaning. For example, instead of matching digits, `\\d` would just match `\\` followed by a `d`.

To match the string `"\\"` we must use the pattern `"\\\\"`. To remember this, consider how R views four backslashes:

```{r}
"\\\\" |> writeLines()
```

<!-- `\d` is not a *string* escape sequence, but it is a *regex* (pattern-matching) escape sequence. For R to use `\d`, we need R to view a pattern string as `\d`. Since `\` is a metacharacter whose behaviour is to escape the behaviour of the next character, we can use `\` to escape itself. the behaviour of the `\` before the `d`. This prevents the error of a non-existent string escape sequence, `\\d` is essentially an escaped `\d` and R views `\\d` as `\d`: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- pattern_string <- "\\d" -->

<!-- pattern_string |> writeLines -->

<!-- "4" |> str_detect(pattern_string) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Similarly with the reference group `\\1`, using `"\\1"` allows R's regex engine to see the escape sequence `\\1`. -->

<!-- The pattern `\n` on the other hand, does not need two `\`. If we used two inside a pattern, R would see the escape sequence `\n`. -->

<!-- R sees an escape sequence. With `\n`, R does not see an escape sequence. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- "\n" |> writeLines -->

<!-- "\`" |> writeLines -->

<!-- "\\\n" |> writeLines -->

<!-- "\\ -->

<!-- " -->

<!-- "\\n" |> writeLines -->

<!-- "\\\n" |> str_detect("\\\n") -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This escape sequence represents a new line. Hence it will match a new line just like `\n`. -->

<!-- With three slashes, R sees a slash and a new line. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- "\\\n" |> writeLines -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- From now on I will use these definitions: -->

<!-- 1. `\` is the metacharacter slash -->

<!-- 2. \\ is the literal slash -->

<!-- If data contains a \\ like in the name "Adam \\Sadowski", R will represent it as `"Adam \\Sadowski"`. This is so that the \\ in "Adam \\Sadowski" is literal rather than symbolic. We can see what happens when we try to print a version with only one `\`: -->

<!-- ```{r error = TRUE} -->

<!-- "Adam \Sadowski" -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This error occurs because  -->

<!-- 1. We told R that we want `\S`, which is called an escape (specifically, an escaped S), rather than a literal \\ followed by a literal S.  -->

<!-- 2. An escaped S is not recognized.  -->

<!-- There are only a few escaped letters that will be recognized by R. The letters are n, r, t, v and f. For example -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- "Adam \nadowski" -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- prints just fine. Since `\n` represents a new line, the string here represents literally  -->

<!-- "Adam \n adowski" -->

<!-- These escaped letters can be found in the Special Metacharacters section of the cheatsheet. -->
