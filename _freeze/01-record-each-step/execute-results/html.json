Since the code that prepares a report can also prepare the data, you could work in a way that both gets the job done and reports on getting it done. That's a win-win!\n\nReports are great client-facing examples of your work (and how you work if you report on data preparation). Before employment, they can be presented to potential employers. After employment, they can be presented to your collaborators during data preparation; maybe there will be decisions that need to be made about the data, and the best way to show why decisions are needed will be through a report.\n\nFor these reasons, this book starts with the fundamentals of writing reports. The files that make reports are called .qmd files. To start a .qmd file, open RStudio. In the top menu, click File then New File and finally \"Quarto Document...\". When you see the pop-up, name the file what you like. Then, in the file, select all (shortcut `command-A` or `Ctrl-A`) and hit `Delete`. Render (i.e. prepare) the document by the shortcut `command-Shift-K` (or `Ctrl-Shift-K`). You will see a document that is empty. That is because we have no lines. Let's get started by writing lines then!\n\n## Lines and Lists\n\nOn your left in Rstudio (what is called the code source), you have numbers like below that represent lines of text or code:\n\n```         \n1   Some text\n2\n3\n4\n5\n```\n\nA list in text can be made by first skipping a line, and then starting the next line with numbers followed by a period (.) which is then followed by a space, or by using a hyphen (-) followed by a space:\n\n```         \n1   Some text\n2\n3   1. Start of my list\n4\n5\n```\n\n~*Lines 1 to 5 will show in your document as:*~\n\nSome text\n\n1.  Start of my list\n\n--\n\nTo create a list within a list, indent twice before using -. Hit tab to indent.\n\n```         \n1   Some text\n2\n3   1. Start of my list\n4           - List within my list\n5\n```\n\n~*Lines 1 to 5 will show in your document as:*~\n\nSome text\n\n1.  Start of my list\n    -   List within my list\n\n--\n\nA list is broken if there is an empty line and a subsequent line that is not indented twice.\n\n```         \n1   Some text\n2\n3   1. Start of my list\n4           - List within my list\n5\n6   This line breaks the list\n7           - Some line indented twice in my code source\n```\n\n~*Lines 1 to 7 will show in your document as:*~\n\nSome text\n\n1.  Start of my list\n    -   List within my list\n\nThis line breaks the list - Some line indented twice in my code source\n\n## Code\n\nCode cannot be written on lines like text. For example\n\n```         \n1   some_code\n2   \n3\n```\n\nwill not work. Code has to be declared in one of two ways.\n\n### Declaring With Single Back-Ticks\n\nYou can insert code into your document using a single back-tick (the ` symbol) before and after:\n\n```         \n1   Here's `some_code` to be shown.\n2   \n3   \n```\n\nTo run, R code needs an `r` after the first back-tick:\n\n```         \n1   Here's `r some_code` to be processed.\n2   \n3   \n```\n\nFor example, the date can be added to a line of your document using\n\n```         \n1   This report was made on `r Sys.Date()`.\n2\n3\n```\n\n~*Lines 1 to 3 will show in your document as:*~\n\nThis report was made on 2025-03-06.\n\n<!-- To see an Rmd document within R, go to R's menu: Tools - Global Options; select R Markdown from the left, find the line \"Show output preview in: \" and select Viewer -->\n\n<!-- Explain why this is not greyed out: ` -->\n\n### Declaring With Multiple Back-Ticks\n\nYou can insert multiple lines of code into your document using multiple back-ticks before and after:\n\n```         \n10    ```{r}\n11    some_code\n12    some_more_code\n14    ```\n```\n\nThe `` ```{r} `` starts the R code chunk and the `` ``` `` ends the chunk.\n\nThe primary purpose of a code chunk is to contain multiple lines of code. We will get an error when preparing our document if we try to declare with single back-ticks like here:\n\n```         \n10    `r  \n11  \n12    Sys.Date()\n13\n14    Sys.Date()\n15\n16    `\n```\n\nInstead we must write this as:\n\n```         \n10    ```{r}\n11    Sys.Date()\n12    Sys.Date()\n13    ```\n```\n\nThe following will be the result of the above chunk in our document:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSys.Date()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2025-03-06\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSys.Date()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"2025-03-06\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen declaring code with chunks (multiple back-ticks), the document will show both the code and the result of the code and this can be customized. When declaring code with single back-ticks, the document will show only the result of the code and this cannot be customized.\n\nSince the back-ticks take effort to write, there is a shortcut to writing an empty code chunk: `command-Shift-I` on Mac or `ctrl-Shift-I` on Windows.\n\n### Summary\n\nTo summarize, compared to declaring code with single back-ticks,\n\n-   Chunks can contain multiple lines.\n-   Chunks can show both the code and the result of the code. This is great for showing your work or explaining your code to readers. This flexible property lets you decide whether the chunk shows the code and the result, only one of the two, or neither.\n\n## Errors\n\nWhen code is not written correctly, errors and probably some frustration will follow. R errors are not known for being *friendly*; they are not kind enough to tell you what is wrong in a way that is easy to understand. When there is an error, you will see it in red text within the Console, which is a box on the bottom left quarter of RStudio (its default layout). The Console is where the code is processed and the result printed.\n\nThere are symbols we need to know to understand the Console:\n\n```         \n> means the line of code processed\n+ means a line of code continuing from the last line\n[1] means the first element of the result of the processed code\n[n] means the n'th element of the result of the processed code\n[[1]]\n[1] means the first element in the first container of the result of the processed code\n```\n\nWhen first learning R, the best way to understand errors is usually not through R's error messages. The best way is by paying close attention to the code and every little detail: misspelling, capitalization, and punctuation.\n\nFor this reason we want to practice good strategies of writing code. Writing involves naming our own objects and functions. But before that, we should also name our files using a good strategy.

For example: `<http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf`\\> gives us <http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf>\n\nTo make this a hyperlink, that is, a shorter, clickable link, write the clickable text (the text you want to the reader to see) in square brackets and the website address in round brackets like so `[text-seen-by-reader](link)`. For example\n\n```         \n1   [File Naming Presentation by Jenny Bryan](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf)\n2\n3\n```\n\n~*Lines 1 to 3 will show as:*~\n\n[File Naming Presentation by Jenny Bryan](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf)\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nRemember, if you are using Windows, use\n\n-   `Ctrl` instead of `command`\n-   `Alt` instead of `option`\n\n**Shortcuts:**\n\n-   `command-Z`: Undo (go back)\n-   `command-shift-Z`: Redo (go forward)\n-   `command-Enter`: Process line of code where `|` is blinking (consistently appearing and disappearing)\n-   `command-option-C`: Process current chunk\n-   `option-shift-arrow_key`: Highlight all to the direction of the arrow\n",
